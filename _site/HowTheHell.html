<p>This readme is for me as much as it is you.  I spent the better part of a day trying to figure jekyll and git pages out. So here is my first writeup!</p>

<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Go get a github account then follow the instructions on how to build Pages <a href="https://pages.github.com">here</a>.  I chose the <i> Leap Day </i> theme</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Follow the tutorial to figure out how the hell <i> Jekyll </i> works <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/">here</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reference material for the <i> Leap Day </i> theme is <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/">here</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>Once you get it working on your local machine, I copied: <br /><code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;jekyll root&gt;/_layouts/default.html</code> <br /> and created my own layouts based on the templates that I woudld be doing.  So for the CTF stuff, I had the following:
    <ul>
      <li>challengeList.html</li>
      <li>ctfList.html</li>
      <li>writeup.html</li>
      <li>default.html  <br /><br /></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This way I would have a template to list the challanges (challegeList.html), a template for listing the ctf’s (ctfList.html), a template for writeups (writeup.html), and the default. 
Each template has a bit of code in it as you can see on github to iterate through lists and populate tables.  The default is a nice blank page with just the title.  This took a bit of time fucking around with the ruby based for loops.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The way I ended up organizing this was to use liquid variables in the ‘front matter’ of <code class="highlighter-rouge">posts</code> to differentiate between a ctf competition and a ctf challenge.  All CTF competitions will get the variable <code class="highlighter-rouge">competition:</code> set to <i>“yup”</i>  and all challenges for that ctf will get the <code class="highlighter-rouge">competitionTitle</code> set as the competition name.  Everything I put up is a liquid <code class="highlighter-rouge">post</code> and I iterate through the posts checking varibles to sort the CTf menus and then just fill in a <code class="highlighter-rouge">post</code> with the challenge write up.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I found that this template had a arrow space to actually print the content after my first build. To change that I created a new <code class="highlighter-rouge">assets</code> folder in the root of the project copied the style.css from: 
<code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;root&gt;/_site/assets/css/</code>.  On the next buld, my style.css overwrote the default that is built by jekyll.</p>
  </li>
  <li>I created a ‘post’ template for the writeups and for the competitions. The end for now…</li>
</ol>
