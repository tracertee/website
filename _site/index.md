# ABOUT

Hey thanks for stopping by!  This page is meant to be a place for me to keep my CTF write-ups and also eventually the blog for a pinball machine that I will be building since there are only 2 real important things in this world: Hacking and Pinball... ya.. um anyways.

My primary goal is to make this site SIMPLE.  I want to make it easy to understand and straight forward.  No script kiddy shit or idiocracy where people demonstrate how much they like hearing themselves on youtube by starting with a "Hey Guys I just wanted to show you..." followed by 19 minutes of bullshit banter tactically hiding the 1 minute answer you wanted amongst the shitty techno trash music playing overtop of their screencapture in 8K resolution posted with 420 resolution.

My promise to the readers will be to keep the bullshit to this paragraph and the blog only and write up the CTF's as simple and straight forward as I can.

Without further ado:
